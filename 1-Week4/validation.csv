__label__-1 "bought this shirt on-line . wanted to love it but just could n't . i ordered the xs and it was huge and way too unstructured for my style .... just did n't have enough shape . had to send it back ."
__label__0 "i fell in love with this dress the instant i saw it . but was disappointed when i received it . first was the color . i chose the green and it was n't what i thought . it was a very unnatural shade of artificial grass . when my husband saw it in the package he thought i had ordered a cheap grass hula skirt . the color was that bad . the fit was the next problem . this dress would have fit nicely if they had just added a side zip and made the top more fitted . the top was loose and that added to the flowy"
__label__-1 "i gulped when i put this in my bag during retailer days because the price was still too much but thought this has to be wonderful to charge so much right ? boy was i wrong . this is a sweater knit with a very deep v-neck that 's incredibly boxy and unattractive . the knit shed all over my pants in the few minutes i had it on . i ordered in xl having never tried this designer and that was a mistake because i generally wear large or medium . it was swimming on me . the stripes are n't as cute in real life"
__label__1 "this is soft to the touch and just beautiful . it is a little roomy but true to size . i love it that way . totally on trend for the season"
__label__1 "what a perfect summer dress ! after reading the previous review i ordered a size up and it 's perfect . the slip is a little snug on the hips but most dresses are on me so i think on most people it would fit very well as long as you ordered one size larger . i ca n't wait to wear this while traveling through europe next summer !"
__label__-1 "thought this would be great for a laid-back wedding in new mexico but did n't fit . i am a 12-14 and the 14 barely fit my chest and arms . not flattering . material did not seem very breakthable . had to return . better luck next time ."
__label__1 "soft and flowy . fit is great . quality is great . i love this dress and i purchased in the turquoise color as well . i have n't worn a dress in 10+ years so i had a lot of reservation that this would be my first . highly recommend . i paired this with 4 short black suede boots and black tights . many compliments ( even from my husband and he does n't usually pay much attention ) ."
__label__-1 "i 'm usually a fan of maeve but this dress is just bad . the fabric is thin and filmy and it stretches to sheer over your chest . the turtleneck is neither tight nor loose it just droops in a most unfortunate way ."
__label__-1 "if you have any cleavage this dress will look awful . the ties drop pretty low & look trashy over cleavage . recommend otherwise - good fabric cool look"

__label__-1 "bought this cami/tank on sale which i 'm glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fitted .. it kinda just drapes under the cami ... the problem is it 's not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank ... but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed through.that was higher than the bottom of my chest .. so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong bra/undergarment ... it simply looks awkward ... not sure if it would 've been better"
__label__-1 "although i love retailer this product is n't the quality or presentation i expect from them . the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess . the fabric was n't soft and fluid as i expected but rather was stiff and a little scratchy . i purchased the ecru version which was also slightly darker than the photo showed . i returned the dress and will keep looking ."
__label__1 "velvet always has made quality clothing and i had purchased the same shirt in another color and i wanted to see if they had other colors they did and i got 2 more . i received in expected time and they were wrapped nicely . thank you for great choices of unique clothing ."
__label__1 "this dress is so pretty- the colors are vibrant beautiful pattern the ruched part in the center hides the tummy ! ! ! the neck line was too low for me so had to wear a red cami underneath which hid the skin showing parts in the back around the waist . so instead of skin color it was now red- even more prettier ! no body could tell ! ! got so many compliments ! ! !"
__label__-1 "so after reading the 2 reviews decided to just order my usual size ( 26 ) thinking they might be a tad snug . wrong ! they were huge ! i looked at the size to see if they sent me a size 30 by mistake ! unfortunately small sizes sold out . quality is excellent as well as style so bummed !"
__label__-1 "i received this top in the mail today not what i expected at all ! it is a great fabric just way too much of it . it is proportionally incorrect width wise . unfortunately this one will be going back ."
__label__0 "i was so excited to get this dress and could tell right away it was beautiful . the fabric and detail are perfect and seem great for summer . then i tried it on .... to say the bust area is tight and not proportioned correctly would be putting it very nicely . it was a total joke . this dress is for very small chested only ."
__label__0 "i love this top . it is very short and hits at a potentially unflattering area if one has wider hips . the fabric and swing to the skirt is adorable ."

__label__-1 "for reference i am 5 ' 5 ' 138 lbs with an hourglass figure and my usual small fit perfectly . the problems : 1. this skirt is not black but a charcoal gray/purple . 2. the sipper is reinforces with a stiff boarder on the inside so no matter where i put the waist it sticks straight out making me look like i have a tail under my skirt . in other words i had a very pointy butt . also the slit or tulip part of the skirt goes all the way up to the waist it needed to be tacked to the other part of the skir"

__label__0 "the quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty . it just made me look super wide . i feel like the waist is too high - not quite empire and not quite at the waist . it just was n't going to work for my body . maybe a different size would work but i do n't like it enough to try ."
__label__-1 "this top does n't at all fit like it does on the model . the mid section is very wide and boxy and the material is thick and almost sweatshirt-like . i typically wear size small or 4 but perhaps an xs might 've fit or looked better . sadly i must return this shirt ."
__label__1 "the print and fit of this dress is perfect ! it 's very flattering and slimming ."
__label__1 "being six feet tall i 'm always combing reviews for the opinions of other tall women and i 'm glad i did on this one ! with the off the shoulder look you can sometimes gain extra length and it 's true in this case . i stayed tts because of length issues and while it is billowy it 's not horribly so . i would think however if you 're between sizes or not worried about height i 'd go with the smaller option . adorable comfy casual while being dressy enough for a night out !"
__label__1 "this was an impulse purchase for me . a year ago i would have never considered a jumpsuit but they are growing on me . i had yet to find one that fit without too much need for tailoring . this one did the trick ! i like that the cut is in such a way that you can wear a normal bra underneath it without it showing . the fabric itself is very lightweight so i would recommend a bra for some support . i like that the fabric is incredibly lightweight so you can wear it on a hot summer day . the jumpsuit is l"

__label__-1 "i loved this dress when i saw it . however the fit was way off . i am 5 ' 7 120 lbs and the small was way too big from the waist down . when the xs arrived i was sure it would be perfect . unfortunately the waist hit way too high above my rib cage and the dress was too short . it was as if it was a petite size . i was very disappointed as this is such a pretty easy dress to just throw on for school . unfortunately neither size looked right on me and i had to return both . the material is also not the s"

__label__0 "i ordered this top in red based on one of the reviews . it is more like marroon . i am very disappointed . the top itself is plain cotton and not that great quality . it is long and has the belt at the back but the fit and quality overall are very plain . it looks a tad dowdy . i am still keeping it because i got it on sale and i can wear it at home with lounge leggings . but it is definitely not dressy . perhaps white may not look as bad . the plain design and marroon dull color do n't help ."
__label__0 "i purchased this sweater because of the cute unique diagonal design . however i was largely disappointed by the fiber of the sweater it is rather coarse to the touch and a bad fit . on the model it looks nice but it was large around the torso yet short at the same time creating an awkward and unflattering fit . i shall be returning it ."
__label__0 "while there is nothing wrong with this top it did n't really have an retailer feel . it looked more like something from a dept store maybe a boutique . i got on sale but sending back bc i just do n't like it that much especially next to my pale skin . i could see it looking much better in someone with darker skin tone . i 'm usually a 8/10 med . small in this top fit well ."

__label__0 "i ca n't figure out if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted ( if so it 's too big but the length works ) or if it 's supposed to sit on my hips ( fits well but too long ) . but the material is really comfortable and the design is different in a good way ."
__label__-1 "i usually wear a medium and bought a small . it fit ok but had no shape and was not flattering . i love baby doll dresses and tops but this was a tent . my daughter saw me try it on and said that 's a piece of tablecloth . it 's going back ."
__label__-1 "the top looks better on the model than in-person . it fits loose and looks boxy and matronly . i do n't like the sleeve length or the top style it just did n't look flattering or good . i am sending it back . looks very boxy ."
__label__-1 "i know we 've gotten to the point that polyester can be acceptable but sometimes it 's still that horrible texture unbreathable mess . unfortunately that 's what this top is made out of . so it runs big its billowy and cute but i could n't get it off quick enough because of the feel of the fabric ."
__label__-1 "this jumpsuit looked so great on the model and looked so hideous on me . i 'm 5 ' 4 and in great shape and this jumpsuit looked absolutely ridiculous .... not to mention it rode right up my backside in the worst possible way . i 'm so disappointed !"
__label__-1 "while i thought it looked really pretty on the hanger when i tried it on it just felt like a mess . perhaps it suits other personalities and bodies . i hated that the zipper was in the front ; i personally find it tacky and gawdy . while the patterns are pretty the material felt like some weird fabric wallpaper and i did n't see how the price was justified with how the material felt cheap to me ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited for this dress to arrive but when it did it was a major disappointment . there is no lining on the skirt portion of the dress leaving it sheer . also the top part along the chest puckered in a weird unflattering way . the colors were beautiful but not enough to to make up for the other design flaws . i am 5 ' 6 140lb and the small fit tts . will be sending it back"
__label__1 "i just love this top it has a flattering cut fun summer colors ! i purchased the white and paired it with the plata chevron skirt . both pieces go with everything and can be dressed up or down . perfect for traveling . only tricky part for me was reaching all the buttons in the back . highly recommend ! ! stock more pieces like this retailer !"

__label__1 "beautiful and very versatile dress . extremely forgiving for post baby bodies while stylish and classy ."

__label__1 "this dress is extremely comfortable . the dress is slightly loose under the armpits but the other than that the overall fit is great . can be dressed up or down !"
__label__0 "i wanted to give this a glowing review but i ended up returning this cardigen . the folds on top added too much to my frame . i do not suggest this for heavier apple shapes . for all others it is incredibly soft and warm . the tan color was weird but they others are simply gorgeous ."
__label__0 "i loved the style and shape of the dress . it does run small . i had to return it because some of the black dots pulled and looked like it might be more of a problem as i wore it"
__label__1 "this dress is so flattering on i was astounded . often the waistline in the petite dress are very high even though i 'm only 5 ' 1 tall but this one hit at the right place and the skirt made me feel slim and tall . the fabric feels silky and the pattern is nice but it is a pretty conservative style and perhaps a bit dark for spring . would be great for work or church but unfortunately does n't really fit my lifestyle and i personally prefer a more unique style for the price . i highly recommend"
__label__-1 "when i saw this top online i thought i 'd love it and immediately ordered it in both colors . they arrived today and i am soooo disappointed . i have never seen such drab colors . the blue is a muddy grayish hue ( like an overcast day ) and the pink is a dusty shade of peach . yuck . and i was hoping the ruffle at the bottom would have a chiffon-like flowy effect . instead the ruffle is made of a cheap looking knit . back these go ..."

__label__-1 "why is it so difficult to find a shirt that does n't expose half of my bra if i lift my arm ? this is cute ( beyond the arm hole issue ) but overpriced . going back ."

__label__-1 "this dress has pretty colors . the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella . it has enough material to make 2 skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways . the photo of model is from side not the front . very unflattering on me ."
__label__0 "i loved the shape of this sweater . the way it draped from the waist was flattering and different . the sleeves were a strange length however between long and 3/4 length which made it look like they the sweater was just too short for me . the color looked peachy or pink in the photo but in reality it was almost skin tone which was not flattering with my olive coloring . paler women might find it attractive . the real downside for me was the fabric which was thin with the flowers mainly printed o"

__label__-1 "i was so excited to receive this dress only to come find out that it was not tweed not the same colors as the picture spandex material the fit runs smaller than most of their dresses and the sleeves are capped . i love retailer and prefer their clothes above all other brands but i was extremely disappointed in this dress ."
__label__1 "i am not usually one for super girly tops but i could not resist this top . the material is beautiful and this top can definitely be dressed up or dressed down i think it is extremely versatile . it is a little bit see-through but if you just wear a nude bra it 's perfect ! i usually wear a 00 or 0 but i got a 2 in this top because it is a little tight in the sleeves/across the shoulders . but if you size up you should be perfect ! super cute and i definitely recommend you get before it sells out !"

__label__-1 "wanted to like this top but it looks terrible and does not lay right . the bust line is not tight enough to contrast the rest of the top being flowy . does not give any shape to the body . do not recommend for anyone with a medium to large chest ."
__label__-1 "i ordered an xxs petite and this hangs like a bag on me . i 'm usually fine with the petite sizing but this did n't work and i 'm so bummed . the dress is soft the blue color is gorgeous but it fits like a bag . i wanted to love this but sadly will have to return . i think someone with curves will love this dress . it is really beautiful quality just does not fit a petite frame ."
__label__-1 "the first time i wore it felt wonderful . had it cleaned and then the back end stated pilling . very disappointed with the price and quality . wish i could return for my money back . sad"
__label__1 "the photos do n't do the top justice . the split back is very unique and adorable . i typically take a size 8 in tops but ordered a 12 since a reviewer suggested it was narrow in the shoulders . the 12 shoulder fit perfectly but the body is way too big -- i was swimming it in . i like it enough that i 'm going to visit the tailor to take in the body . with the sale price it is worth tailoring ."
__label__1 "this blouse is pretty sheer but perfect for a summer day . good coverage in the front and under arms on the sides for limited bra exposure and a very cute opening in on the lower back ."
__label__0 "just a warning the yoke on this dress has sequins underneath . i 'm not a sparkle kinda gal so as soon as i saw that the dress went right back in the package and will be going back to the store . i wish that had been described or more evident in the pictures to me it cheapens the whole dress which would otherwise be adorable ."
__label__1 "very slimming lovely dress . a nice addition to your fall/ winter wardrobe . the embroidery is lovely fabric soft and comfortable . sized perfectly . so happy with this beautiful black dress ! ! !"
__label__1 "the embroidery is breathtaking . it is more flattering and interesting in person . i would highly recommend it ! . it is true to size figure flattering and unique . the only reason i gave it four stars for quality is because the neck is a little itchy . if you are looking for a show stopper and conversation piece this is it !"
__label__0 "the dress is too big . i got size 4 after checking the measurements chart ( for reference : 5 ' 7 125 lb ) . it is too wide not as fitted as in the picture . the cut is too deep ( might work better for a bustier lady but looks pathetic on me ) . the pattern is too bright much brighter that in the picture ( i got red pattern ) . it 's not that the photos represent the colors inaccurately it 's just ... the colors are much more vibrant in real life . the material is heavier than i expected ."
__label__-1 "i was really wanting a nice white summer blouse to pair with patterned skirts . unfortunately this fell short as it was huge . not only was it big it flared at the bottom . it would be perfect if i was sporting a baby bump but not what i am going for right now . if the tank was a bit slimmer i would have kept it as a tunic.i 'm sad that i 'll have to return it ."
__label__0 "i really wanted this skirt to work but it did n't look very flattering on me . a great midi length and very cool pattern so hopefully will work for others !"

__label__0 "such a cute dress but it runs large . i 'm 5 ' 4 130 lbs and am typically a size 4 can wear a size 2 in certain clothes . i tried on the xs and it was still too big . i would of bought it in an xxs but they are sold out . really a comfy laid back dress that would be comfortable in summer . if they get more xxs i 'll buy it ."

__label__0 "this dress looked amazing in the picture . i am 5'10 and since the model was 5 ' 9 with the dress dragging on the ground i assumed it would be long on me as well . even with flats this dress is an awkward length . the description says it is 62 in length but i measured it and the dress i got was 52. i will say that it 's a beautiful fabric and the quality of the dress is great . it just does n't look like the dress in the picture at all in terms of the way it hangs and the length ."
__label__-1 "the catalog shot and model shot are completely different . it 's like not even the same dress . the neckline color the quality of lace"
__label__-1 "the stone color was nice but the material is heavy and does n't breath . if you are partial to more natural fabrics i would go with a different item . upside would be that i imagine this shirt will last ."
__label__-1 "when i tried these on in the store i was thrilled - they were comfy as yoga pants and the fit was divine . i thought i had found the perfect jeans and i splurged on them for my birthday . after wearing just two times they are baggy and the knees are totally bagged out saggy and faded . so disappointing - i want my $ 180 back !"
__label__0 "not sure why it has gotten good ratings and or why sold out online periodically . awkward fit and flares quit a bit at waist . also has extra material at waist line so does not look flattering ."

__label__0 "this dress is sort of a mixed-media dress . the top colored portion is a slinky knit that dolan uses all the time . i like it a lot . the bottom is a tight silky twill-like weave . the silhouette is straight which is what attracted me to it but when i put it on i realized that the waist was n't going to work for me . the split came at a point too high for me to belt and the sleeves made my wide shoulders look dowdy . i am not a person that wants to put on a dress and have to style the heck out of i"
__label__1 "i absolutely love this dress ! the fabric is very light and airy while not being revealing . the color being nude as indicated is a nice change from plain white or off white and the embroidery is just beautiful and makes this dress quite unique . i love the fact that it is a tunic dress which lends to less of a structured look and more of an easy casual style . i recently wore this dress to an out door bbq and was both cool and comfortable all day . i also received many compliments from friends and"

__label__0 "i purchased this and it ended up sitting in my closet for a couple of weeks . i bought it in the green and i felt it did nothing to enhance my figure . it 's kind of a boring design . i like the cowl neck ( rare on a tunic ) and the sleeve details . the colors do n't seem to go well with standard black leggings . overall unimpressed ."
__label__1 "i 've only worn the sweater a handful of times but i 'm already in love with how soft and comfortable it is . it 's a bit on the baggier side but that does n't stop it from looking great . i 've gotten complements on it every time i 've worn it . i would highly recommend it to people who do n't like the typical scratchy/itchy textiles ."
__label__1 "the print layers and fit of this dress remind me of the 1990 's but in a good way ! the outer dress is voluminous and flowy so i understand why some reviewers feel the dress runs large . the embroidered slip is tts and quite the cherry on top . i really appreciate that styling detail . 140 # 36dd 5 ' 3 and i chose medium regular length not petite since i 'm older and wanted the length ."

__label__0 "i know this is supposed to be a loose flowy fit which is exactly the style i love . however this is beyond tent-like . i 'm 40 weeks pregnant and i can probably fit two of me in my normal size small . fabric is very thin and pattern looks like drab wallpaper . huge bummer especially after seeing a few 5-stars ."

__label__0 "i bought this scarf/dress for 20 % off on mother 's day weekend . i really like how it looks and can be worn over a bathing suit or just as a dress but it is not worth the money . it is poor quality a scarf stitched together with an attached chord that you tie around your neck . you can make this yourself or wait until it is at least 50 % off the original price ."

__label__-1 "tried this dress in a small . i am 5 ' 6 135lbs 34c . the small was huge - the sash helped some but looked like a potato sack on me . also i noticed the fabric was piling slighly in the store . i had high hopes for this dress but left this one in the store ."

__label__0 "i loved this top in the blue and wanted so badly for it to fit however it was very unflattering on my 5 ' 7 frame . the bottom hemline is straight across all around whereas i thought it was longer in the back . i could see this looking great on a really petite frame . runs large xs fit however was n't flattering"
__label__0 "this sweater is ok. i love love love bell sleeves so i thought for sure this would be perfect . i thought it would be a great sweater to transition from winter to spring but once it arrived i knew i had to return . the sleeves are not only bell but very long and the sweater fits chunky on your midsection . i like my sweaters more flowy . if you like fitted-style sweaters that are a bit roomy you would like this once . also it 's a bit itchy for me-but i 'm rather sensitive and if i 'd loved this on"
__label__-1 "i love this dress as far as the fit goes . it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how it 's cut . that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy . it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest . was n't just me but my store people also agreed . had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great but even though my boobs are of mostly equal size they looked too crazy . it 's quite noticeable on . so sad : ("

__label__0 "first off this shirt is a hd in paris brand not floreat . i love floreat clothing so that is why i initially bought this blouse . i like the idea and the coloring of the shirt . the biggest drawback for me was that it is completely see through . i just bring myself to get a strapless cami just to wear this one top . please change brand name ."

__label__1 "this shirt is very flattering and drapes beautifully . i am 5 ' 7 175 and the medium fits perfectly . i bought in navy but am disappointed in the other options - i would have bought all of them had they been nice colors but the yellow and orange are really garish and unflattering on any skin tone and the white way too see-through which ruins the visual lines of the top . bummer ! but i wear the navy every day so give that a thumbs-up ."
__label__1 "i get so many compliments every time i wear this dress . friends strangers younger older and even the pharmacist at my drugstore wanted to know where i bought the dress . it has a 70 's vibe to it fun and swingy . perfect for fall in florida with sandals or when it gets cooler i think it will look great with leggings and boots . i purchased the orange and dark gray in a medium petite ( i 'm 5 ' 4 ' and 135 ) and it hit just above my knee . my favorite dress right now !"

__label__-1 "i was surprised by the other reviews . expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward . the hi-low cut with so much bulk just was n't flattering . i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body . the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more . it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as i 'd hoped . it went back ."

__label__0 "definitely pj quality . i have a fairly thin frame and this hung on me like a tent . and it 's very thin so it works as a swim cover but definitely not a dress for anything else ."

__label__-1 "i did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have . it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there 's the first reason i did n't like it . secondly there is a piece of fabric behind the laces presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat . it wrinkles up behind the lacing making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top . it is too long for me the top hitting at top of thigh . this top is just reall"

__label__1 "this dress looks better when wearing i am 5.8 regular size s or 6. cup 34 d and fits perfect . length and width . in the front is shorter while the back has that pretty extra length . the video that is showing here is pretty much the full length . but in case you need to adjust you can shorten easily . i wish the slip is the same length as the dress . i want this dress for a wedding anniversary by the beach so i will need to add some extra fabric . i hope it helps ."
__label__1 "i saw this at a store today and am so glad i tried it on . i 'm usually xs in retailer tops but for this shirt i preferred s for a loose fit . the lace detail is elegant and very pretty ."
__label__-1 "right out of the bag this top did n't really match the one pictured here ( it is the right top though ) . the fabric was heavy and felt damp -- the way something feels coming out of the wash. very odd . and the fit is nothing like what 's shown on the model . the v is not fitted or nicely wrapped ( or even tacked in place ) -- it was just two loose droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged ( i 'm neither flat chested nor busty"
__label__0 "i love the colors in this top but i returned it for a few reasons . the material is extremely fragile ; with small kids i knew this would be snagged all over after my first day of wearing it . my other issue was that it came to just below my belt on me . i was under the impression from the photo that it was more of a tunic style top . i 'm 5 ' 6 and it just did n't look that way on me ."
__label__-1 "i was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which is n't my first choice . that was the least of the problems with this jacket . i love sparkle and i love beautiful detail none of the elements by themselves was a problem . the sum of the parts did n't work though . the end result was an unflattering confusing mess . the silhouette plus the frayed edges plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast plus the zipper were just too many things to go t"

__label__-1 "these pants fit tts and are ask pictured in length on me ( 5 ' 5 ) . i can go between a 4 and a 6 and tried the 6 and they were fine . that said the fabric completed turned me off . it is that sort of stretch fabric with a sheen to it . i did not find them to be the wonderful wardrobe basic i thought they 'd be- the fabric is just too stiff and the sheen made them feel cheap unfortunately ."
__label__1 "i could live in this top : it 's versatile enough to be dressed up or down or worn as a bottom layer ; the color offerings are basic enough to match anything ; and it 's comfortable enough to wear around the clock . note that it runs small . i had to size up to a medium even though 80 % of everything else i wear is size small ."

__label__0 "i ordered this and did n't even try it on when it came . the color was not as i expected ... it had pinkish undertones and it just was n't what i was looking for as far as color . also the fabric is very thin not like the other two tunic dresses i have ordered recently from retailer ( toscana tunic & sandscape swing dress ) . it was also easy to see that this runs large . oh well thought i might have one more fresh summer tunic dress to throw on in a flash but i 'm happy with the other two ( i was finally a"

__label__0 "i was so excited when i saw this dress ! i love this color and the poplin sleeves . i was so sad when i tried it on though the back poofed out in such a weird and unflattering way . i think it is because there is a pleat high up in the back but then it seems like it gets narrow again around the hips . strange . also the material is kind of stiff and seems poor quality . i do love the way the top and the sleeves look on me though so i am actually considering keeping it and just making it into a top"

__label__-1 "the back of this t-shirt looks cute but the front looks really weird . the material in the back is quite stiff but the grey material is soft so the front gray area ends up hanging weirdly and looking uneven and messy . i appreciate asymmetrical clothing but to me it looked like a patched up rag from the front . it fits true to size ."

__label__1 "i was so excited to see that these were on sale post holidays . love the style and the fit . my only disappointment was that they do n't have as much stretch as i thought they would ( i wrote above that it runs small but if it had more stretch then the sizing would be ok ) . for reference i 'm 5 ' 5 and 10. i usually wear 25 in pilcro pants but these felt tighter . i would exchange for a 26 but they 're sold out unfortunately !"
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress . i ordered an xsmall and a small . i am 5 ' 6 and 110 lbs slender build . the xsmall fit great everywhere but the waist band was completely out of portion for the dress . both sizes will have to be returned . possibly if you have a more straight up and down figure it will fit better and pull in your waist !"
__label__0 "this runs huge not large huge ; and hung in quite a baggy way . bought a medium ( 5'10 150 lbs ) and i could have gotten an x-tra small . maybe if there were free shipping i would have reordered but now its just too much of a hassle"
__label__1 "this jacket is so well made and absolutely beautiful . i usually wear a size 4 or small in everything at retailer . sadly i ordered a small and will have to return it too tight on chest and arms . i recommend going a size up . also this jacket is really cropped probably needs a hifh waist pant to compliment it otherwise might appear too short ."
__label__-1 "i loved this skirt when i tried it on . the material is soft with a bit of stretch . i 'd say this runs a little large . for reference i 'm usually a size 2/4 in retailer and the 2 was still a little large towards the end of the day as it stretched out . however my disappointment was with the buttons.i wore it for a day when all of a sudden the top button popped off . fine that button is the most used . i sewed it back on myself and even reinforced the top three buttons that i use to take on and of"

__label__-1 "i wanted to love this coat so bad . the material is lovely and it 's beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off . if you have any hips forget it ( my hips are 38 ) - you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy . the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders .... like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted it was weird . but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it was n't a size thing . i bought a size medium at 5 ' 5 and 140 pounds ."

__label__0 "the shirt design is very nice but it fits very loose . it will not look good if you are heavier as this shirt will make you look wider because of the baggy fit . the sleeves though are fitted and feel a little tight . the material of the sleeves also is very itchy and feels like some wool material ."
__label__-1 "i 'll start by saying over the years i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailer 's products . this dress represents all of my frustration . cheap cheap cheap material . low thread count . elastic ! ! ! around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm . i mean this dress is a total disaster - and looks nothing like the photograph shown ."
__label__0 "too floppy ; light and comfortable material but the tie-neck needs a shirt with a bit more structure ."
__label__0 "i agree with the other reviewer this is a nice piece . i felt so-so about it when i tried it on though . see below . ___________ pros : - not too heavy or warm due to being part linen/cotton blend making it breathable and great for more milder temperatures . - soft floral arrangements with lovely pattern throughout the sweater . - lovely collar giving it a sophisticated feel . - ran tts . i 'm 5 ' 9 hourglass with some meat on my bones and found the medium to be an ideal fit . ___________ cons :"
__label__-1 "maybe i should n't have sized up to an xl but i 'm not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit . the vee is quite low and i 'm busty . it 'll be really low if you 're smaller on top . the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me . not tight at all . it 's almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view i looked like a really wide green apple . i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i would n't recommend it ."
__label__0 "ordered a petite and it was not as dark of a denim like the picture . the pockets on the backside are wide and are not flattering if you have any curve to your rear . makes you look wider than you are ! pocket on front are also large which accentuate thighs . these were returned immediately as it did not work for me ."

__label__0 "i wanted to love this shirt . it 's got a thicker material a flattering shape and the uniqueness for a basic top . however when i put this on it just looked like it was ill-fitting over the chest . i think if the pull was below the chest it would be much better ."

__label__0 "this is a heavy dress - it 's surprising when you lift up the hanger how much it weighs because it looks like a light sundress . and on my frame which is pretty thin it hits my shoulders and then my hips and just falls ... so the heft of it means there 's no waistline ... it 's an odd fit . the color is gorgeous but the lack of shape made this a no ."

__label__-1 "i was able to get this on sale . when it arrived it was missing half of the rhinestones . i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way . it also was missing the little bag with extra stones . i 'm reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse ? any help from anyone would be appreciated . i hate to part with this but where was quality control ?"

__label__1 "i love this dress . i 'd get it in both colors if i could ! the cut and fit is beautiful i 'd suggest sizing down if you feel like it 's too boxy or lacks shape . the bottom skirt is round enough to where you can twirl ( # 1 thing to look for in a dress ; ) ) and it 's just overall a classic pretty dress . my only complaint is that the overlay cut out seems a little bit delicate and i 'm afraid it will be ruined after a few wears but it seems to be holding up fine so far and is n't incredibly delicate like"

__label__0 "i really like the color of this and the feel but that is where it ends . it does not come with the gorgeous flattering belt that it is pictured with and is cut without shape so it does not fit to your body and show off any glorious womanly curves . i could purchase the belt with it but i do n't prefer to purchase products that can not stand on their own ."

__label__-1 "i ordered this dress in the blood orange and have a few complaints . while it appears to be made with quality it runs really large . also in the picture the fabric appears to have a sheen and be somewhat dressy . the actual fabric is just flat cotton . it 's a very casual dress not as dressy as pictured . it 's also quite shapeless on . i 'm returning it ."
__label__0 "this top has dry clean only . did n't like the fabric . plus mine was a return . i also returned it because the left arm has a hole . now it 's for sale again . if your looking to buy a large . do n't ."
__label__0 "this picture does not do this skirt justice . it is gorgeous . however the waist was so small that the sequins dug into my waist making me think of a medieval torture device . unfortunately it was the largest size so i ca n't size up . i 'm 4'11 so the length was perfect - it came to right above my knees . i love the skirt so much that i 'm considering liposuction ."
__label__0 "bought this on a whim . i had been wanting a new maxi dress and the bodice looked really cool online . ordered it in black . it fits true to size however the material is a bit on the thin side and where the fabric crosses over on the lower waist line ... it leaves a love handle lump . without the bulk it would be great as overall look is kind of cool . however i am on the fence on this one . for the money there are better maxis out there ."

__label__0 "i like what they were going for here and the fabric . but it falls short in that i ca n't wear it to work -- -the back keyhole is massive so i ca n't wear my normal bras and the very wide neck also shows bra straps so unless i want to go with a strapless bra it 's not useful for me . i want to feel loose and soft and summer comfy and my strapless bras are anything but that . i 'd go without but that is a no-no where i work . i may try getting a size smaller . i wear a med . and i got a small and mayb"

__label__1 "so i love this top . i got it in black and red . both are amazing and go with about anything . they run a bit large . i sort of forgot to read the label and thought it was just a cotton turtleneck . i threw it in the washer on regular settings and cold water and hung it to dry . i would say it shrunk 10 % at most . beyond that no difference . in fact it fits better after it shrank since it was a bit big . obviously if you do not dry clean this you are going against manufacturer recommendations but i"
__label__-1 "i was attracted to the feminine design of the dress the silhouette the flouncy skirt ; however i ordered the red motif pattern and hated the splotchy dark colors ."
__label__0 "not for petite women you need to have a long figure for this tunic to drape like it does on the model . if it ever goes on sale i will purchase it but not worth the full price for me at the moment ."
__label__1 "this vest is a stunner ! the dark brown suede is so beautiful . the bronze grommets on the front are a perfect enhancement to the vest . it 's hard to see in the picture but the stitching is also top notch . yes it is a little pricey but it 's an investment piece that you will wear and not only get a ton of compliments but feel special when wearing it too . it 's a keeper ! ! !"
__label__0 "i was so excited to order this beautiful coat . it does seem well made and is very soft . unfortunately the fit is completely off and is overall large . i ordered a small as this coat appears slightly more snug on top a-line on the bottom with three buttons . i am 5 ' 6 and weigh approximately 145. i was expecting this coat to be body-skimming . instead it was overall large and the bottom of the coat awkwardly flared . the pleat on the back is unflattering . sadly going back ."
__label__0 "contrary to some of the reviews posted the dress is not excessively sheer . you ca n't see black underwear thru the fabric but you can see the body 's silhouette in front of a light source . it 's not lingerie sheer but more like a medium weight gauze ( without the wrinkles ) . if you 're older or modest the sheerness may bother otherwise ( due to the print ) it should n't be much of a factor . now on to the size ... i 'm a plus size girl ( size 18 ) and based on reviews saying the dress was huge i ordere"

__label__1 "it 's a pretty dress my only concern is the sleeve length . it 's an awkward length and makes the dress look a little frumpy . i turned the sleeve up once and it looks so much better ! . or if you are a savvy sewer you may want to tighten a little in the arms so the sleeve is a bit more fitted . overall quality and feel is very good . i usually fit into a 6 but for this dress i ordered both 6 and 8 and kept the 8. the chest is a bit snug and the button pops open if you do n't order the correct size ."

__label__0 "i finally ordered this at this incredible mark downed price ... but i see why . it is cute but serious size issues i have a bust but smaller everywhere else but i did order up because of it being a jumpsuit ... i would have needed 6 more to even zip the top part ! i have many trendy jumpsuits in my closet and this is a first ! if you are flat chested you may want to try at this great price as it would be a great piece for sitting by the fireside next fall/winter ... never too soon to plan ahead !"
__label__-1 "i really love the idea behind this . however the fit does n't work for me . i 'm usually a s or xs in retailer tops and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops . this one runs small though - the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width . the neckline was very high ( higher than it looks in the model photo ) and the armholes were too big . so i do n't think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue . the other criticism is that the front is not lined ."
__label__1 "i ordered ivory in xl because this brand tends to run tight if you 're well endowed . it 's a beautiful color and i love the contrasting plaid lining the inside of the collar and cuffs . have n't decided about keeping it because it looks oversized ( but cozy ) and it 's really long . it almost touches the top of my knees in back . sooooo pretty though ."

__label__0 "i wanted to love this . it is so cute and the xxsp my usual size fit perfectly . however there was a fatal flaw in the construction . the hem was not sewn properly - very asymmetrical and lopsided . instead of a scoop like shown on the model it was much longer on one side than the other . i thought maybe it was just how it hung on me but i took it off and laid it on my bed and i could clearly see that it was sewn wrong . this is going back . i ordered another one ( now it 's on backorder ) hopefully"

__label__0 "this dress has so much potential- loved the pattern and the neckline . however only one side of the waist was gathered with a fake sash leaving the other side plain . the gathered side was super flattering while the other side showed any little lump or bump . needless to say i 'm returning it ."
__label__1 "i tried this dress on in the store . i wear either a s or xs in retailer clothes . its loose fitting so i went with the xs . the arm holes were tight but have very cute buttons if you look closely at the picture . you can also roll the sleeves up and there is a coordinating plaid underneath which adds a nice touch . great length not too short or too long . the grey color is much prettier in person . i felt it had a little more of a blue tint . for reference i am 5 ' 6 124 lbs and 32b ."
__label__0 "like the idea of this shirt so much . but the neckline was still way too low- the top of my bra was visible . wishing the under layer really covered as no way i 'm going to another layer to an already layered shirt . might just be my body type so might work for someone else but sending back ."
__label__0 "i really like how this looks on the model but in real life this top is much tighter . i was hoping for a good layering top and have been playing around with the trend of lace up tops . i bought it without trying on figuring a small would work but it was much too tight and the lace top reminded me of vans shoes . i returned it a girl much tinier than myself has it and it is very cute on her . so best works on a model body type figure than someone with even slight hips ."
__label__1 "the fit and style of this dress are beautiful . it 's a bouncy fabric that is light and comfortable . i really wanted to love it but the color just did n't work for me . the pictures make it look like it 's a nice cream color but it 's very tan and i ca n't pull it off with my coloring ."
__label__-1 "the tank looks nothing like the one pictured mainly because it 's tissue-paper thin . also i ordered it in two sizes - xs and s as it can be hard to tell which one will fit . i started with the xs and quickly discovered that it ran large . the armholes hit halfway to my waist . obviously i did n't even bother opening the size s. both will be returned ."
__label__0 "the sweater is very very warm . it looks okay not the best but not bad . i had high expectations so was disappointed to see no closure i do n't wear sweaters and jackets without closures . i like having the option of closing buttons if it gets any colder . so i am sending it back ."
__label__0 "this runs really big . i usually wear s or m so i got a small but i need the xs in this top and it is sold out . i do n't have a store close by ( about an hour away ) and i hate paying shipping for returns ! i will either have to plan a trip to the store or try to exchange for size over the phone . i debated keeping the small but it is really too big .... i love the style though !"
__label__-1 "i ordered two sizes . when the package came i was skeptical as it was very light and thin . both shirts were in the bag . the style is just okay . the shirt is extremely light weight . i was not impressed with the fabric . i am returning both . definitely did not think it was worth the price ."
__label__0 "this top is beautiful to look at but did not fit me like the model . it was tight across the bust but very poofy at the bottom which normally i like but not this time . sad ."
__label__0 "this top was so pretty online ! unfortunately it did not work for me- the front was a bit more shapeless in person though the back was gorgeous with a button gather at center . the color appeared yellow online but was a bit more green in person . also the armholes were very low so it would need a camisole or no bra ."
__label__1 "i do n't own any peach outerwear because i did n't think it would complement my skintone . this cozy bomber proved me wrong . wonderful quilting pattern and a vintage dye job that 's eye catching . great for layering and the color goes with my autumn and spring wardrobe . this is not a fitted style it 's relaxed and a bit poufy at the sleeves and waist just like a regular bomber jacket . i chose medium petite and it fits just right . i 'm a 36d 135 # 38-28-35 ."
__label__0 "after eyeing this product online for awhile i was able to try it on in store . i 'm so glad i did because while this dress is lovely it is clearly not designed for my body type . i have a small rib cage and a large bust ( 32h ) which is i think what caused the keyhole to be so gaping on me . additionally the straps of the dress were up by my neckline instead of lying properly on my shoulders which was unflattering and left my bra straps clearly visible . the fabric was gorgeous and soft and the"
__label__0 "disappointed this did n't fit better . the pockets stuck out on the sides and it was baggy through the middle . you could also see the pockets through the outer layer of the dress . the color is more like a chartreuse than the picture . it 's really pretty !"
__label__0 "this sweater is extremely roomy . the cut is very wide - wider than it is long the sleeves are dolman style and the neck is a little loose . with a lot of manipulation i managed to convince myself that i was n't wearing a tent but i would suggest sizing down and also being tall and thin if you can . i 'm keeping mine despite a funky fit on my hourglass frame because i 'm exploring funky town lately . join me at your own risk !"

__label__1 "i am so glad i read the reviews for this before i purchased it . i am 5 ' 5 and 135 pounds and normally wear a size 6 in dresses . i would normally buy a small but sized down to an xs and it was perfect ! it 's a beautiful dress and very flattering !"
__label__0 "i do not love these pants . while the fabric is nice they make me look rather dumpy . i highly recommend the essential taper pant instead which has beautiful tapering legs and made me look more slender . these pants make me look like i 've put on 20 pounds and they also make me look rather squat . perhaps they would look good on someone tall but at 5 ' 6 these are a miss for me !"
__label__0 "i ordered this in a size 4 and it is great quality . the only problem is the size of the slip . the top is very tight across my average chest but fine elsewhere - odd fit . the dress fits great and i debated finding another slip but ultimately decided to return it ."
__label__1 "love this dress ! very feminine and flattering . i would say that it runs true to size or a little big . size down for a snug fit at the waist ."
__label__-1 "the neck is so big on this sweater i could n't make it lay right . the shape of the sweater is odd . it is really wide on the upper torso but tapers near your waist . it did not look as depicted on the model . the sweater is a lovely color i liked the two-tone but overall the fit was too weird for me . material is soft and it felt really nice on but just too oddly shaped and a crazy big neck ."
__label__1 "this dress will take you through fall winter and spring . i love all the stitching and design detail . it has a nice swingy skirt that is quite a bit longer in the back ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this dress ! the material is beautiful ! but sadly i agree with other reviewer . the model definitely has this pinned back ! i am on the small side ( 5 ' 5 120 lbs straight figure very tiny girls ) and this dress looked awful . totally swallowed what little shape i have and the swing did make me look prego in front and back . the fabric is stiff so i think that adds to the sticking out oddly . as far as sizing the arm jokes fit great . xs ordered and length was good but wish the swin"
__label__0 "i love the color blocking but dress hangs a little strange on me . love the pockets thought about sending it back and decided it is very comfortable i will wear it but not quite what i was hoping for ."
__label__-1 "the fit was not flattering at all but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos ."
__label__1 "i thought these were great everyday shirts for the price . i got them on sale over christmas . they fit well and i really love the striped shirt . the navy is an odd color and looks strange with jeans but i love the top regardless"
__label__1 "nice loose-fitting dress to wear in the summer and to transition into the fall . i had no problem with the slip being too tight . 5 ' 3 '' 118lbs and went with my normal size 2. it was loose through the body but sizing down would have made the dress too tight on my shoulders . it 's great with boots or flats !"
__label__-1 "beautifully made shirt however the sizing is way off . the sleeves and across the chest are really tight while the rest of the shirt fits fine . if you get a size larger then the shirt in the body is to large . would recommend if you have really tiny shoulders arms and chest . such a shame since i really love the shirt ."
__label__-1 "this top was way too short ( i 'm only 5 ' 1 ) and way too wide . the cut of this top was so wide it looked like a tent on me . i really wanted to love this top because the material and style ( sleeves ruffle ) are beautiful unfortunately there is something wrong with the cut . i 've have several blouses made by one fine day which fit nicely for some reason this top did not . i ordered in my usual s size even going to an xs would not work because the cut is wrong ."
__label__1 "i saw this shirt in store a while ago but could not believe the price and was not about to spend my money on it . however when it went on sale and there was an extra 40 % i decided to get it . i like the top it 's cute and fun . however it does poof out a little in the midline . this top goes great with jeans or shorts and it is cute but definitely not worth full price for this ."

__label__1 "gorgeous colors high quality . my only word of caution is that the top part is very tight . if you have a large chest ( c+ ) this is going to be snug or not fit at all . i 'm wearing it now in pregnancy but i think it will also look great post-partum . can be dressed up or down ."
__label__0 "i 'm 5 ' 2 and 105 lbs ; normally a size 25 petite for most jean brands but learned after receiving my online purchase that these jeans run large . i exchanged them for a size 24 petite and thought they fit okay at first but after testing them around the house they kept stretching and i felt like they were going to fall off my waist ! did n't want to wear a belt with these because it distracted from the relaxed style . sadly had to return my purchase ."
__label__-1 "on me thsi was ginormous looked like a mu mu . it is pretty but there was just too much fabric even in the smallest size . the quality seems nice and it looks pretty but overwhelming . i will say i think it would work on tail lean people i have pretty muscular shoulders so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier no joke . fabric is soft though . give it a try just not for me ... ref : 115 lbs 30dd 26.5 in waist ."

__label__0 "this dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline . but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area -- so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty . a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just did n't feel comfortable about . some darts could have made a nicer fit here . but this is a a great dress if you do n't mind a super body con fit ."

__label__-1 "i love the photo of this and because the reviews were so positive i ordered it . i was shocked when i opened the package . first the fabric is not the silky rayon cotton blend i was expecting . it looks and feels more like a cheap cotton . it does not have the drape or feel or look i expect in a kimono which brings me to the second disappointment . it is not a kimono at all . it has no kimono sleeve no sleeves at all in fact . just a slit in the side of the body of the garment you put your arm throu"
__label__0 "i really wanted to love this . sadly the first thing i noticed was how tight it was in the arms and across the back ( size up maybe even two sizes ) . secondly it 's see through ! a top like this looses it 's finesse to me once i can see my pant line and bra . it 's very difficult to do the three buttons in the back yourself and finally good luck taking it off without getting make up all over the neckline . someone dubbed it the poor man 's pineapple top . i could n't agree more sigh . i really did want"

__label__1 "just bought this at the store . just to be safe i thought i would try it on before ordering just to confirm the size . that was a good idea . ( i am a 38b 5 ' 9 and have variable results with trying to order with the size charts . ) the large looked nice but was slightly too large in the chest . when directly compared to the medium it seems the major difference is the length -- the large was > 1 longer than the medium . i did not find either to be itchy and the construction seems totally ok ."

__label__0 "the image online does n't depict this blouse well .. my complaint is that the sweater portion looks crooked and shrunken where it has been cut at waist level and the ruffles have been attached at the hips . maybe i received a flawed piece either way i 'll be sending it in for return ."

__label__0 "i ordered the blue stripe and white in size large . i did n't like it worn off shoulder but it does stay in place which is a good thing . and it looks okay worn on the shoulders . i find the fabric so uncomfortable and itchy that i could n't wait to take it off immediately . i tried them on again a second time still hopeful with the same outcome . sadly returning ."
__label__-1 "this shirt was on sale and it was a good price . that is where the goods ended ... the shirt was not flattering . i sent it back asap !"
__label__1 "okay this is the cutest sleep jumper i 've ever owned . it 's soft and cozy and even a tiny bit sexy . i give it 4 stars because it 's a little on the thin side ; not sheer but close . really fun little piece . definitely recommend ."
__label__1 "i had read all the reviews about the regular length being too long ( they were out of stock on the petite when i ordered ) but i took a chance and ordered the regular size . i love it ! it is a little long in the back but i think that makes it a little more fun than your standard plaid shirt . so cute with skinny jeans and leggings ! it is one of my favorite fall tops ! i got the blue but might go back and get the red since it would be so great for the holidays !"
__label__-1 "i tried this shirt in a small ( my usual retailer size ) and it was very unflattering . the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made . however this shirt is so unstructured and oversized i might as well worn a brown paper bag ."
__label__1 "this garment is beautiful because the fabric has great drape to it . i am probably between a small and xsmall but ordered the xsmall . it is snug but i have decided to keep it and can wear a cami underneath just in case the buttons gap just a little . i am concerned that going up a size with leave the neck area too gaping . it is also a little snug in the elbow area ."
__label__-1 "i should have listened to the reviews that said this top was too boxy but i did n't believe them and bought it anyway . i was wrong ! this top is so boxy and wide just awful ."
__label__1 "i buy everything that retailer sells in chambray . this top did not disappoint . it is so comfortable and the back the way it is slightly lower than normal is very sexy without being revealing . the straps fall off of your shoulders a bit but i do not find it annoying . i am not big busted so i did n't have the sizing issue that others seemed to have ."
__label__0 "i 'll start with saying that it 's a beautiful coat- i get tons of compliments and love the color . it runs a little big but it 's meant to have to a slouchy oversized quality to it . my only complaint is that i 've had it for about 3 weeks and already one button has completely fallen off and the two inside fasteners already feel loose and very delicate . there 's no extra buttons to replace the old one with and i 'm worried more of the coat is going to fall apart . super bummed about the construction qu"
__label__-1 "so disappointed . bought these in a 29 and should 've gone with a 28. they 're super cute - i got the green . the fit is off . like the other reviews they stretch out way too much . i would return these but have already washed them . they wash terribly too . there are weird fading marks all over even when washed in cold water like the tag states . so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these . i 've been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i 've been severely"
__label__-1 "i love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great . this dress does not meet those standards . on the 2nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke . i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress i 'm dissapointed ."
__label__0 "great summer skirt can be dressed up or down . the band top is weird but you do n't have to style it as pictured . i may get the top hemmed down the road . i have a 32 waist and got a size large ."
__label__0 "though the quality is good and the fabric is both sturdy and soft the cut of this top made this a no-go for me . it 's a bit short in front and also boxy which is emphasized by the dolman sleeves . i ordered the coral color and it was much brighter - almost neon-y - as opposed to the soft salmon color my screen shows . i regretfully returned it ."
__label__-1 "i ordered these because i loved the wide cut and overall look . but returned them because they fit weird . too tight around the too high waistline ( and normally i like a high waistline ) . fit ran small . and the overall quality of the fabric was n't as nice as i was hoping for . pretty disappointed ."
__label__1 "i felt compelled to write a review to tell everyone to size up . i am 5 ' 4 130 lbs 34d and normally wear a size 4 ( give or take ) . i debated between the 6 & 8 after reading the reviews and went with the 8 and so glad i did ! if you 're in doubt between sizes even after sizing up go up one more especially if you 're bigger up top . mine fit * okay * in them but probably could have even done better with a larger cup . what 's weird is that they sew in liner cups so you ca n't remove them without cutting"
__label__1 "i purchased this dress to wear to a horse race but will also be wearing it all summer long ! the material is light weight and has a vintage flare to the print . the button in the center of the dress add an extra detail that keeps the dress pretty and casual ."
__label__1 "cozy soft fabric . love the snails on the pockets and the cute buttons . size down if you want a more tailored fit ."
